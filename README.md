I am building a facial emotion recognition model using ssd model.
I am using ck+ dataset.
In training.ipynb i am training the model.
And saving the model in .h5 file.
Then using the pretrained model for predictions
when you run the myapp.ipynb it starts your webcam and provide accurate predictions of your Emotions.
Thanks.
